Github Jobs Search
==================

This program implements a search of jobs posted on Github using the [jobs API](https://jobs.github.com/api).

It is missing the implementation for three important generators. Once these are implemented, the program can be run as the following:

```
python3 jobs.py
```

This should print a list of available jobs matching a given search query.
